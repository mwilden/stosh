<h2>Remote engine help</h2>

<p>
  Beginning with version 2.0, Stockfish is able to run the chess engine
  (the part of the program that does the actual thinking and selects
  the moves) remotely, for instance on your home computer.  Only the
  user interface runs on your device, while all computations are done
  on the remote computer, and the phone and the computer communicate
  wirelessly.  The advantage of doing this is that it makes the
  program much faster and stronger.  If you have a modern dual- or
  quad-core computer, Stockfish should play better than the human world
  champion.
</p>
<p>
  In order to use this feature, you must first install a program
  called GlaurungServer on your computer. This program is available
  for download from <a href="http://www.glaurungchess.com">http://www.glaurungchess.com</a>. If you can't find a version for your OS
  there, don't despair, but try again later. Versions for all the
  major operating systems (32-bit and 64-bit Mac OS X, Linux and
  Windows) will be available in the near future.
</p>
<p>
  Instructions about how to set up GlaurungServer and connect to it
  from your device is included with the program.
